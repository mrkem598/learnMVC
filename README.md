# learnMVC
learnMVC repo is aimed to teach on how to separate the model , view and controller. I am hoping that, everyone of you will benefit from this repo to learn how MVC(Model View Controller) works.
What is MVC?
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. Each of these components are built to handle specific development aspects of an application. MVC is one of the most frequently used industry-standard web development framework to create scalable and extensible projects.
