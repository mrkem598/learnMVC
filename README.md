## learnMVC

learnMVC repo is aimed to teach on how to separate the model , view and contro<br>
ller.                                                                         <br>
I am hoping that, everyone of you will benefit from this repo to learn how MVC<br>
(Model View Controller) works.                                                <br>
What is MVC?                                                                 <br>
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an<br> 
application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the <br>
controller. Each of these components are built to handle specific development<br>
aspects of an application. MVC is one of the most frequently used industry-  <br>
standard web development framework to create scalable and extensible projects.<br>

Now let us take a look at how the execution of an MVC application takes place<br>
when there is a certain request from the client. The following diagram       <br>
illustrates the flow.                                                        <br>
